# Research

**Ethiopia** - 

The Government of Ethiopia (GOE) has focused on the construction and expansion of power generating projects to deliver reliable electricity. Approximately 90% of the installed generation capacity is from hydropower while the remaining 8% and 2% is from wind and thermal sources, respectively.

Ethiopia's journey in renewable energy production stands as a beacon of inspiration for nations seeking to balance energy needs with environmental stewardship. By harnessing the power of its abundant water resources and embracing the wind that sweeps across its highlands, Ethiopia has not 
only transformed its energy landscape but has also paved the way for a brighter and more sustainable future. As the nation continues to navigate the challenges of the evolving energy sector, Ethiopia serves as a testament to the transformative potential of renewable energy in driving inclusive development and fostering environmental resilience.
